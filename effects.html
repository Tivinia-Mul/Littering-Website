             <h1>Causes</h1>
            <p> How does Littering start.? How littering start in our community today is that when people such as Adults, Teenagers and children are getting way to hyped and others being lazy they tend to throw their rubbish either on the floor, in the toilets, in the park but mostly outside the window from which they use transport from. With these examples this is the picture of which our community and others are living today. With rubbish being flown around like birds our mangere community is notrealising the affect that this is giving to the polution of the air of which we breath from potentially errupting how our bodies function because of the amount of litter that is being thrown out in the community. From my point of view as u walk in the fleamarket of the community of Mangere aside from all the busses it is a beautiful place with trees looking like they are coconut trees, it is beautiful. But what makes it ugly is the amount of rubbish u will find around, for example from the moment u enter the Mangere Town Centre grounds you will notice that there is Glass everywhere on the floor with plastic bags flying around, gum all over the floors of the town centre it is a errupted place.  Keep New Zealand Beautiful announces National Litter Audit results: New Zealand’s litter problem has worsened since 2019. National Litter Audit 2022 cover pageKeep New Zealand Beautiful (KNZB) has today announced the findings of the 2022 National Litter Audit (NLA), the most comprehensive and scientifically robust litter audit in New Zealand. The 2022 NLA follows on from a baseline audit carried out by KNZB in 2019 and compares data and insights between the two data sets. The 2022 NLA found that, overall, the litter problem in Aotearoa is worsening, with the total number of items, volume and weight of litter at a national level all increasing since the audit in 2019. Developed in consultation with Stats NZ, the Department of Conservation and the Ministry for the Environment, the NLA involved experienced environmental field researchers collecting and analysing litter in specific fixed sites, recording the key metrics of the litter collected as well as brand data.“The results of the 2022 NLA are surprising and alarming, even off the back of years of Covid-19 restrictions,” says Heather Saunderson, CEO of Keep New Zealand Beautiful.
            “Despite the efforts of tidy Kiwis nationwide, the audit results really speak to the fiction of New Zealand’s clean green image and illustrate the need for government, industry and Kiwis to take immediate action. “The 2019 NLA provided a baseline for litter intelligence in New Zealand, painting a picture of how litter impacts our communities. The 2022 results serve to highlight that the need for educational and behaviour-change programmes, when it comes to litter in New Zealand, is more important and urgent than ever.” Even though the 2022 NLA shows a drop in some material subcategories, across the board the litter problem in New Zealand has grown worse, with the total number of individual items, the combined weight and estimated volume of litter nationally all increasing.

            <p>The effects of polution put our health and our animals including insects in danger. As you look through the eys of our animals.
                The careless act of littering from a simple piece of plastic thrown on the ground can clog storm drains or that piece of plastic may go straight to the ocean and harm wildlife. Littering is a health hazard which causes harmful bacteria and germs. Removing litter from the environment costs everyone money. Littering is the most important environmental issue our nation is facing because it is done so easily and carelessly. People do not realize how much we spend on cleaning litter every year or how it affects us all.  The practice has become second nature, we have avoided to educate ourselves on how this affects us in the long run. Littering needs to be minimized or if possible, completely stopped if we could help it because we are doing more harm to the earth. Carelessness and laziness are two common factors that contribute to littering. We have a piece of trash in our hands and a trash can is in site, yet we decide to just throw it on the ground. Littering has become second nature even if it is unintentional. We assume that the trash we throw will eventually disappear into thin air and it won’t affect our surroundings. Little do we know that every little piece of trash thrown out the window all adds up. That small piece becomes a pile of trash that ends up clogging storm drains, contaminating water and endangering wildlife. According to McWhorter, “Sustainability involves conserving resources to prevent their depletion, protecting ecological processes, and eliminating waste and pollution, so as to ensure that our society’s pratices can continue and our civilization can endure” (p. 394). Everyday items such as bottles and plastic that are carelessly thrown on the streets eventually end up around wildlife. Litter creates an unhealthy environment towards wildlife that could put them in danger. A lot of the time animals end up eating the litter, have a hard time digesting it which puts them in a fragile state where they may end up dead. The living environment for wildlife is also affected by litter because their surroundings become trashed. Marine wildlife such as whales,

    <h1>Causes</h1>
    <p> How does Littering start.? How littering start in our community today is that when people such as Adults, Teenagers and children are getting way to hyped and others being lazy they tend to throw their rubbish either on the floor, in the toilets, in the park but mostly outside the window from which they use transport from. With these examples this is the picture of which our community and others are living today. With rubbish being flown around like birds our mangere community is notrealising the affect that this is giving to the polution of the air of which we breath from potentially errupting how our bodies function because of the amount of litter that is being thrown out in the community. From my point of view as u walk in the fleamarket of the community of Mangere aside from all the busses it is a beautiful place with trees looking like they are coconut trees, it is beautiful. But what makes it ugly is the amount of rubbish u will find around, for example from the moment u enter the Mangere Town Centre grounds you will notice that there is Glass everywhere on the floor with plastic bags flying around, gum all over the floors of the town centre it is a errupted place.

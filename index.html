            <h1>Littering in our Mangere Community</h1>
            <p>In our world today it is known to be said that our world as of auckland today is living in a world where littering seems to be tolerated. With 5674 tons of litter being flown in all areas of our enviroment today.
             From the numbers of 5674 tons per year of littering this may not seem as much but to most people it is. As u look around our enviroment today there arent as much animals sticking around our enviroment as their used to be, with diffrent types of birds flying around and cats running around freely in our world today there u would hardly see that. 
             This comes from the cause of Littering, because of their being so much litter in our world today our animals are being chocked on by what most of us would know as littering being chocked up on plastic bags, plastic bottles, cans and many more.
             More than 200,000 marine species have been documented, and perhaps two million marine species are yet to be documented.[4] 
             Marine species range in size from the microscopic like phytoplankton, which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge cetaceans like the blue whale the largest known animal, reaching 33 m (108 ft) in length.[5][6] Marine microorganisms, including protists and bacteria and their associated viruses, have been variously estimated as constituting about 70% [7] or about 90% [8][1] of the total marine biomass.
             Marine life is studied scientifically in both marine biology and in biological oceanography. The term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning "sea" or "ocean".Facts About Extinct Animals
             More than 900 species have gone extinct over the last 500 years.Habitat loss is when the area in which an animal hunts, lives and breeds becomes under threat and is badly damaged or destroyed, often due to human activity.
             Habitat loss also occurs through natural causes, such as natural disasters, e.g. volcanic explosions, earthquakes and meteors. A perfect example of extinct animals that suffered habitat loss were the dinosaurs.</p>
